BRIEF:

The Big Juicy Finder

The popular Facebook group ‘The Big Juicy Appreciation Society’, a platform for reviewing pints of Tennents Lager, requires a new application that collects and displays reviews written by it’s users.


MVP:

A user must be able to:
Write a review
View all reviews 


A pub will contain: 
a list of reviews
a lat and long 
a list of all the reviews made in that pub

A review will contain:
a user and a pub
a price
an overall rating
a text description providing more detail


The app should display a ‘news feed’ of all reviews, ordered by most recent, displaying all relevant information.



EXTENSION 1

A user might be able to:
View all their reviews
View all review for a specific pub
Save favourite reviews into a list and view the list

There should be a tab for the user to view a list of any reviews that they have ‘saved’.


EXTENSION 2

There will be a map which plots the location of each pub. At each location the user can view all reviews written for this pub.


FURTHER EXTENSION

The user should be able to filter the map based on minimum price and/or minimum overall rating.


SUPER EXTENSION

implement an auto-suggestion function into the map, so that you don’t need to manually create a location?
